## Failures in detail

### N22: How do I get my name corrected on the grade card?

- expected `not_covered`, got `answered` (status answered != not_covered)
- retrieved: AR §6.3, EE §6.2, SF §4.2, AR §8.3, HH §3.1, AR §9.2
- answer: You can have your name corrected on the grade card by requesting a correction of the clerical error within sixty days of the declaration of results. The Controller of Examinations will then amend the grade card accordingly.

## Borderline questions (run, not graded)

Either response type is defensible for these; see `tests/questions.json` for why.

| id | question | got | cited | answer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B01 | Can I use a scientific calculator in the examination hall? | not_covered |  | The rulebook does not address whether a scientific calculator is permitted in the examination hall. The closest passage, EE §2.1, lists specific permitted items such as pens, pencils, and an eraser, but does not mention calculators. |
| B02 | Will I get my hall ticket if my hostel fee is unpaid but my tuition fee is paid? | not_covered |  | The rulebook does not address whether an unpaid hostel fee prevents the issuance of a hall ticket. The closest passage, AR §12.2, specifies that a student with outstanding tuition fee dues shall not be issued a hall ticket, but it does not mention hostel fees. |
| B03 | Is the examination fee refunded if I withdraw from an exam? | not_covered |  | The rulebook does not address this situation. The closest clause covers a related case: No, the examination fee is not refunded if you withdraw. The regulations explicitly state that the examination fee is not refundable after the commencement of classes. |
