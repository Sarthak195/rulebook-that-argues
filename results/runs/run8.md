## Failures in detail

### N22: How do I get my name corrected on the grade card?

- expected `not_covered`, got `answered` (status answered != not_covered)
- retrieved: AR §6.3, EE §6.2, SF §4.2, AR §8.3, HH §3.1, AR §9.2
- answer: You can request a correction of a clerical error—such as a misspelled name—within sixty days of the declaration of results by contacting the Controller of Examinations. The Controller will review the error and issue a corrected grade card.

## Borderline questions (run, not graded)

Either response type is defensible for these; see `tests/questions.json` for why.

| id | question | got | cited | answer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B01 | Can I use a scientific calculator in the examination hall? | not_covered |  | The rulebook does not explicitly state whether a scientific calculator is allowed in the examination hall. The closest relevant provision is the list of permitted items, which says that any item expressly permitted on the question paper may be brought in. |
| B02 | Will I get my hall ticket if my hostel fee is unpaid but my tuition fee is paid? | not_covered |  | The rulebook does not address whether an unpaid hostel fee prevents the issuance of a hall ticket. The closest passage, AR §12.2, specifies that a student with outstanding tuition fee dues shall not be issued a hall ticket, but it does not mention hostel fees. |
| B03 | Is the examination fee refunded if I withdraw from an exam? | not_covered |  | The rulebook does not address a refund of the examination fee when you withdraw from an exam. The closest passage states that the examination fee is not refundable after the commencement of classes. |
