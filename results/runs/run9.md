## Failures in detail

None.
## Borderline questions (run, not graded)

Either response type is defensible for these; see `tests/questions.json` for why.

| id | question | got | cited | answer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B01 | Can I use a scientific calculator in the examination hall? | not_covered |  | The rulebook does not address whether a scientific calculator is permitted in the examination hall. The closest passage, EE §2.1, lists specific permitted items such as pens, pencils, and an eraser, but does not mention calculators. |
| B02 | Will I get my hall ticket if my hostel fee is unpaid but my tuition fee is paid? | not_covered |  | The rulebook does not mention hostel‑fee status as a condition for issuing a hall ticket. It only states that a student with outstanding tuition‑fee dues will not receive a hall ticket (AR §12.2) and that hall tickets are issued to those who have no outstanding tuition‑fee dues (EE §1.2). |
| B03 | Is the examination fee refunded if I withdraw from an exam? | not_covered |  | The rulebook does not specifically state whether the examination fee is refunded if you withdraw from an exam. The closest provision concerns withdrawal of admission, stating that the examination fee is not refundable after the commencement of classes. |
